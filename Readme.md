# Empowering Health and Fitness: Investigating the Impact of Apple Watch on Younger Adults' Cardio Fitness and Health Behaviour Decisions

## Project Overview
This project aims to investigate the impact of the Apple Watch on the cardio fitness and health behavior decisions of younger adults. The study involves analyzing pre- and post-survey data to understand changes in perception, trust, and health behaviors.

## Data Collection
Data was collected through pre- and post-survey questionnaires. The surveys included questions on:
- Perception of effectiveness
- Trust
- Changes in health behaviors and decisions

## Analysis
The analysis involves:
1. Descriptive statistics for each survey section.
2. Calculation of composite scores for each section.
3. Reliability analysis using Cronbach's alpha.
4. Correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables.
5. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA to compare pre- and post-survey results.
6. Paired t-tests to compare changes in perception and behavior.

## Hypotheses
1. There is a significant correlation between trust and changes in health behaviors.
2. There is a significant difference in perceived effectiveness before and after using the Apple Watch.
3. Changes in perception of effectiveness are correlated with changes in health behaviors.

## Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations such as:
- Boxplots for composite scores
- Histograms for distribution of scores
- Q-Q plots for normality checks
- Scatter plots with regression lines
- Bar plots for comparing pre- and post-survey results

## Conclusion
The findings from this study will provide insights into how wearable technology like the Apple Watch can influence health behaviors and perceptions among younger adults.
