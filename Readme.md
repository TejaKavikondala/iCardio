# iCardio: Investigating the Impact of Apple Watch influence on Younger Adults' Cardio Fitness and Health Behaviour Decisions

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project explores how the **Apple Watch influences cardio fitness, health-related decisions, and behavioural changes among younger adults.**  
Using a **Mixed-Methods Research (MMR)** approach, we combine **quantitative data (surveys & statistics)** and **qualitative insights (interviews & thematic analysis)**.

---

## ✅ Research Questions
**RQ1:** How do younger adults perceive the effectiveness of the Apple Watch in monitoring and improving their cardio fitness?  
**RQ2:** What impact do the Apple Watch’s heart rate notifications and ECG system have on users’ health-related behaviours and decisions?

## 📈 Key Quantitative Results

### ✅ RQ1 (Perceived Effectiveness)
- Mean score remained stable (Pre: 3.26 → Post: 3.22)
- No significant change (p = 0.8253)

👉 Users consistently believe Apple Watch helps cardio fitness.

---

### ✅ RQ2 (Impact on Behaviour)
- Strong positive correlation between **trust** and **health behaviour changes**  
  **r = 0.8106, p < 0.0001**
- Significant differences based on trust levels (ANOVA p = 0.000045)

👉 Higher trust = more positive health actions.

## 🎤 Key Qualitative Themes
1. Health & Fitness Tracking
2. Device Reliability & Trust
3. Behavioural & Lifestyle Impact
4. User Experience & Engagement
5. Psychological & Social Influence

---

## 🔄 Integrated Insights
✅ Apple Watch is perceived as effective and motivating.  
✅ Heart rate & ECG features trigger real health decisions.  
✅ Trust plays a crucial role in behaviour change.  
✅ Users feel empowered, aware, and engaged.

## 🧠 Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
- First factor explains **43% variance**
- Scree plot suggests **1 dominant factor**
- High communalities (0.708–0.961)

👉 Core constructs are strongly related.

---

## ⚠ Bias & Limitations
- Existing Apple user bias
- Brand loyalty
- Younger, tech-savvy sample
- Limited generalizability to older adults

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The Apple Watch **positively influences cardio fitness awareness and health-related behaviours**, especially when users **trust the data and perceive it as effective.**  
Its **health alerts (heart rate, ECG)** directly motivate real decisions like **activity adjustments and medical consultation.**
